Crossing the Bridge (due 04 Oct 2019)
There are n people who wish to cross a bridge at night. At most two people can cross the bridge at the same time. There is only one flashlight and they need the flashlight to cross the bridge. So the flashlight has to be brought over to the starting side so that more people can cross.

Each person has a different crossing speed that determines the time that person would take to cross the bridge. The speed of a group is determined by the slowest member. You will have to design and code an algorithm that will determine the shortest time to cross the bridge for the n people under the constraints mentioned.

Input
The input will be in a file called bridge.txt . The input file begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself that indicates the number of cases that follow. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is a blank line between two consecutive cases.

The first line of each case contains n, the number of people that will be crossing. This is followed by n lines each giving the time taken by a person to cross the bridge. Assume that n will never be greater than 20 and the times will be less than 60.

Ouptut
Your output will be the minimum time for each case separated by a blank line.

You will submit the file Bridge.py. We will be looking at good documentation, design, and adherence to coding conventions. Your code must have the following header:


#  File: Bridge.py 

#  Description:  

#  Student Name:  

#  Student UT EID:  

#  Partner Name:

#  Partner UT EID:

#  Course Name: CS 313E

#  Unique Number: 

#  Date Created:

#  Date Last Modified:
For this assignment you may work with a partner. Both of you must read the paper on Pair Programming. .

If you are working with a partner both of you will be submitting the same program from both accounts but make sure that you have your partner's name and eid in your program. If you are working alone, then remove the two lines that has the partner's name and eid in the header.

Use the Canvas system to submit your Bridge.py file. We should receive your work by 11 PM on Friday, 04 Oct 2019. There will be substantial penalties if you do not adhere to the guidelines. Remember Python is case sensitive. The name of your file must match exactly what we have specified.

Your Python program should have the proper header.
Your code must run before submission.
You should be submitting your file through the web based Canvas program. We will not accept files e-mailed to us.
Here is the Grading Criteria.
