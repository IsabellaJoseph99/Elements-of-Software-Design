Recursion Exercises (Due 07 Oct 2019)
These problems are taken from the Java Section of Coding Bat but modified for Python. You will have to download the program recursion2.py.txt and fill in the header. Remove the .txt extension. That extension is there because some browsers may not allow you to download executable files.

For each function that you wish to write, remove the comment symbol (#). Write your code and test it on the command line. Supposing the function you wrote was groupSum. Then you will execute the following command:

python3 recursion2.py groupSum
You do that for every function that you write. Do not modify the functions that have not been assigned.
I would like you to do the following problems. For each of the problems you will have to modify the sub_sets() function that we wrote in class.

groupSum
groupSum6
groupNoAdj
groupSum5
groupSumClump
splitArray
splitOdd10
split53
Use the Canvas program to submit your recursion2.py file. We should receive your work by 11 PM on Monday, 07 Oct 2019. There will be substantial penalties if you do not adhere to the guidelines. Do work with a partner for these exercises.
